🚀 Excited to share our latest embedded systems project! 🎮

My classmate Abdelkerim El Bani and I just completed a multi-functional desktop system powered by STM32F407 Discovery Board and ESP8266! 

🔧 What we built:
✅ Real-time sensor integration (ultrasonic distance & IR color detection)
✅ Retro gaming system (Snake, Pong, Tetris)
✅ WiFi-enabled email client with USB keyboard support
✅ FreeRTOS multitasking with 6+ concurrent tasks
✅ Custom OLED interface with smooth navigation

💡 Key highlights:
• HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for precise distance measurement (2-400 cm)
• Infrared color sensor for black/white surface detection
• Full Gmail SMTP integration via ESP8266
• Thread-safe operations with mutexes and semaphores
• Advanced GPIO conflict management for shared pins

This project pushed our skills in embedded C, real-time operating systems, I2C/UART communication, and hardware integration. Special thanks to our professors for their guidance! 🙏

Tech Stack: STM32 HAL, FreeRTOS, ESP8266, Arduino, USB Host
